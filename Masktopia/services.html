              <h3>Qualities of a good face mask</h3>
              <p>The quality of the face mask you are wearing is important because it lessens the danger of contracting covid-19. If your facemask is of bad quality, you could be putting yourself in danger without knowing it.
</p>
              <p>The highest quality face masks use at least two layers of tightly woven cotton fabric.
Some face masks have an additional filter to provide extra protection. The filter in the mask needs to be dense enough to block small particles, while also being breathable and comfortable for the user.
</p>
              <p>You must be able to breathe comfortably while wearing your facemask. In other words, you should not need to remove your facemask in order to take a breath of air.
If you have a reusable mask, you will need to wash your face mask after every trip out of the home. If buying your mask online, make sure to look at reviews that comment on the masks wear and tear.

              <h3>How A Face Mask Works/Why You Should Wear One</h3>
              <p>Many people can have the corona virus yet not exhibit any symptoms. This is why wearing a mask even if you do not feel any sickness symptoms is necessary.
</p>
              <p>According to this 2013 study, masks led to more than a threefold reduction in the amount of virus that people sprayed into the air. Consequently, the amount of people affected by the virus went down.
</p>
